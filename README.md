# FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Personal Portfolio

This repository showcases my responsive web design skills through the completion of the FreeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio project. This project was undertaken as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Project Overview

The Personal Portfolio is a web page designed to showcase my own work and skills. I approached this project differently from the standard FreeCodeCamp template, adding my own unique touch to the design and layout. With a focus on responsive web design, I utilized HTML and CSS principles to create a visually appealing and functional portfolio.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that defines the structure of the personal portfolio page.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file responsible for styling the elements on the personal portfolio page.
- `images` - This directory contains various images and logos used in the portfolio.
